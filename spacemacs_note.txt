helm-file中，C-h上一级目录

** File related operations
1. =SPC p f= (find a file in current project, it looks like the Ctrl-p plugin in Vim)
2. =SPC f f= to find a file start from the current directory
3. =SPC f L= find the file across the whole Mac system
4. =SPC f l= find file literally(I also enhance this func with ffap)
5. =SPC f h= find file in hex mode(I also enhance this func with ffap);C-c C-c回到普通模式
6. =SPC f o= open with external program
7. =SPC f E= sudo edit
    SPC b w     取消RO模式
8. =SPC f D= delete current file and buffer
9. =SPC f j= open the current file's dired mode
10. =SPC f r= find the recent file with ivy
11. =SPC f R= rename the current file
12. =SPC f v= add local variables
13. =SPC f y= yank current buffer's full path
14. =SPC f a d= find the current visited directory with fasd.
15. =SPC f C d/u= convert file encoding between unix and dos
16. =SPC f e d= find the .spacemacs/.spacemacs.d/init.el file
17. =SPC f e i= find the .emacs/.emacs.d/init.el init file
18. =SPC f e l= helm locate library file
19. =SPC f c= copy file
20. =SPC f b= show bookmarks
21. =SPC f s/S= save buffers



** buffer related operations
1. =SPC b .= buffer micro state (hydra)
2. =SPC b b= switch buffers, i rebind it to =ivy-switch-buffer=, because I could see recent use file in buffer
3. =SPC b d= kill a buffer
4. =SPC b f= find buffer file in finder
5. =SPC b B/i= I bind it to ibuffer; 像dired操作文件一样操作buffer
6. =SPC b h= go to home
7. =SPC b k=  kill matching buffers
8. =SPC b N= new empty buffer
9. =SPC b m= kill others
10. =SPC b R= safe revert buffer
11. =SPC b s= switch to scratch buffer
12. =SPC b w= toggle buffer read-only
13. =SPC b Y=  copy the whole buffer to clipboard, the content could be used in other programs
14. =SPC b P= paste to the whole buffer
15. =SPC  <tab>= switch between the current buffer and the last opened buffer

 Topic: Window, project and layout operations

** Layout related operations
1. What's  layout in spacemacs? How to use layout in spacemacs?
2. =SPC l L= load layout file
3. =SPC l l= to switch between layouts
4. =SPC l s= to save layout to file
5. =SPC l <tab>= switch between the last layout and the current layout
6. =SPC l o= custom layout
7. =SPC l R= rename layout
8. =SPC l ?= to open the help window, learn more operations about laout

** Window related operations
1. =SPC w -= split window blew
2. =SPC w /= split window right
3. =SPC w .= window micro state
4. =SPC w 2/3= use predefined window layout
5. =SPC w == balance window
6. =SPC w b= switch to minibuffer
7. =SPC w d= delete the current window
8. =SPC w h/j/k/l= move to window
9. =SPC w m= maximize window
10. =SPC w H/J/K/L= move window to position with evil direction key
11. =SPC w u/U= window undo/redo
12. =SPC w o= switch to other frame
13. =SPC w F= make a new frame
14. =SPC w 1/2/3/4= goto window with window number
15. =SPC w w= go to other window one by one
16. =SPC w W= ace window
17. =SPC t g= toggle golden ratio
18. =SPC t -= center point

** project related operations
1. =SPC p f= visit files in project
2. =SPC p b= visit buffers in project
3. =SPC p p= switch to project
4. =SPC p l= switch to project and create a new layout
5. find-file-in-project is a really handy package

Fore more about the project related operations, dig into it with which-key.
